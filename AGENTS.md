# Repo Coding Conventions

- Use 4 spaces for indentation in all JavaScript files.
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed.
- Always run `npm test` before committing. If no test script exists, note this when summarizing test results.
- Document new code with concise JSDoc style comments.
